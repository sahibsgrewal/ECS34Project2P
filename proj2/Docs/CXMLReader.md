Constructor:

explicit SImplementation(std::shared_ptr<CDataSource> source): Initializes the data source and creates the XML parser. Sets up handlers for XML element start, end, and character data events.
Destructor:

~SImplementation(): Frees the resources associated with the XML parser.
Public Methods:

bool IsEnd() const: Checks whether the end of the XML stream has been reached, returning true if both the data source is at the end and the entity queue is empty.
bool ReadEntity(SXMLEntity& entity, bool skipCData): Reads the next XML entity from the queue, optionally skipping character data entities. It refills the entity queue if it is empty and returns true if an entity is read.
Private Methods:

void RefillEntityQueue(): Fills the entity queue by reading from the data source and parsing the data using Expat. It handles the end of parsing when the data source is exhausted.
void HandleStartElement(const std::string& name, const std::vector<std::string>& attributes): Processes the start of an XML element, creating an SXMLEntity and pushing it onto the queue.
void HandleEndElement(const std::string& name): Processes the end of an XML element, creating an SXMLEntity and pushing it onto the queue.
void HandleCharacterData(const std::string& data): Handles character data, merging it with the last entity in the queue if it's of the same type.
Static Callback Functions:

static void StartElementHandler(void* context, const XML_Char* name, const XML_Char** attributes): Callback function for handling the start of an XML element. It retrieves attributes and invokes the corresponding handler.
static void EndElementHandler(void* context, const XML_Char* name): Callback function for handling the end of an XML element.
static void CharacterDataHandler(void* context, const XML_Char* data, int length): Callback function for handling character data.


Class: CXMLReader
This class provides an interface for reading XML data from a data source.

Constructor:

CXMLReader(std::shared_ptr<CDataSource> source): Initializes an instance of CXMLReader, creating a unique instance of SImplementation with the provided data source.
Destructor:

~CXMLReader(): Default destructor for CXMLReader.
Public Methods:

bool End() const: Checks if the end of the XML stream has been reached by delegating the call to the IsEnd() method of the SImplementation.
bool ReadEntity(SXMLEntity& entity, bool skipCData): Reads the next XML entity from the data source through the ReadEntity method of SImplementation.
Usage
To use the XML reader implementation:

Create a data source that inherits from CDataSource.
Instantiate CXMLReader with the data source.
Use the ReadEntity method to read and process XML entities from the data source.
Check for the end of the XML stream using the End method.
